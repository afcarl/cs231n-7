# CS231n

These contains the assignment for **CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** Stanford class. This is one of the best classes present around for anybody who wants to enter in the field of Deep Learning.

Course notes and slides are available at the [course website](http://cs231n.github.io/).
Lectures are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC)(2016) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk)(2017). Both 2017 and 2016 are same except 2017 has a few more topics. Also in 2016 the main lecturer is Andrej Karpathy, therefore I recommend watching 2016 videos. Watch 2017 lecture which tells about libraries and frameworks and also Deep Reinforcement Learning.
